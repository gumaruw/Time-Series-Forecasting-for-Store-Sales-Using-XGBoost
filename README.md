# Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Store-Sales-Using-XGBoost

This project aims to predict store sales using advanced time series forecasting techniques. The model leverages XGBoost, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to handle complex interactions and trends in the data. This project was developed as part of the Kaggle competition [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting).

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling and merging multiple datasets to form a comprehensive dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracting valuable date features and implementing rolling statistics to capture trends.
- **Model Training:** Utilizing XGBoost Regressor for accurate time series forecasting.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training and testing.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for various tasks such as data preprocessing and feature extraction.
- `submission/`: Contains the final submission file for the competition.

## Results
The model achieved a validation RMSE of `X.XX`, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting store sales.
